If you want to contribute to RTranslator but you don't know where to start, here is a list of possible things to do:

| Description | Status |
| -------- | ------- |
| Night mode theme | Not started |
| Mic manual mode setting to choose whether to start with automatic or manual mic mode in WalkieTalkie or Conversation mode (separate settings for the two modes)| Not started |
| Button to stop and eventually repeat the TTS in the messages of WalkieTalkie and Conversation mode| Not started |

The possible states are: Not started (you can open a new pull request), Started (with the link of the pull request) and Done.

If you want to do a contribution that is not listed here, feel free to do it and send a pull request, but if it is a complicated and long feature to implement you should write to me first at contact.niedev@gmail.com, to be sure that I will accept it before starting.

Before doing any pull request please read the [contributions guidelines](https://github.com/niedev/RTranslator/blob/v2.00/CONTRIBUTING.md).

Thank you very much for wanting to contribute to this project! 🚀
